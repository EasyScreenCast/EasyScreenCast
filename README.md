# Translation
If you want to help with translations, just follow these simple step:

1 - Create a new folders for the translations(if NOT exist), where $lang is a code language [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Usual-Language-Codes.html#Usual-Language-Codes](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Usual-Language-Codes.html#Usual-Language-Codes)]

```
mkdir -p locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES
```

2 - Translate the string with the program Poedit by using a .pot files (locale/messages.pot)

3 - Save these files in the same directory of .pot files, use the code language for the name of them (locale/$lang.po)

4 - Convert in binary these .po files, where $lang is a code language, with that command:

```
msgfmt locale/$lang.po -o locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/EasyScreenCast@iacopodeenosee.gmail.com.mo
```

# Converting to GIF

There are a wide variety of video editors that should be able to convert
the screencasts to GIFs. An easy way to convert a file using the command
line is:

```
ffmpeg -i _filepath -pix_fmt rgb24 _dirpath/_filename.gif
```
